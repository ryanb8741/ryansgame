<p> You just clicked a button that makes you instantly lose a game. Why would you do that? Why would you want to lose? I wouldn't put a button to let you go back to the game because you don't deserve it, but you can just click the back button and for simplicity's sake, here is a button!
<br>


</br>
<button type ="button">
<a href="ryansgameindex.html" onclick="return theFunction();">Go Back</a>

<script type="text/javascript">
    function theFunction () {
    }
</script>
</button>
</body>
